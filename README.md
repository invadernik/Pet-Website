# Pet-Website

Hi everyone!!
I'm Nikhil and at the time when I'm writing this, I'm in BCA DS 1st Year.
I've Done some design modifications in the Figma Design that was handed over to everyone.
I've choosen my own color palette that is warm and can have connection to pets, that are the main subject of the design given.
I've use multiple CSS properties to make small Animations in the design and buttons.
I'm not much proficient in Java Script so I took help from Claude and Qwen 2.5 to make the css elements functional.

Hope everyone who's reading this like my work
thanks!
